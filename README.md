# LowerToUpper
This simple program saves time while doing inventory.

I'm assigned to inventory at work sometimes, so I made this program that ensures that every serial number that was previously entered into inventory with undercased letters and converts them to capital letters without having to type the whole serial number in again. This saves a ton of time in the long run. :) 


To run this, simply open terminal up and write in "java -jar" and then drag the file "lowerToUpper.jar" onto the terminal window.

The program will prompt you to enter a serial.

After entering a serial, pressing enter will copy the capitalized serial to your clipboard.
