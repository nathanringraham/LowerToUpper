# LowerToUpper
This simple program saves time while doing inventory.

I'm assigned to inventory at work sometimes, so I made this program that ensures that every serial number I enter is made up of capital letters.


To run this, simply open terminal up and write in "java -jar" and then drag the file "lowerToUpper.jar" onto the terminal window.

The program will prompt you to enter a serial.

After entering a serial, pressing enter will copy the capitalized serial to your clipboard.
